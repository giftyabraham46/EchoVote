### Project Description  
EchoVote is a platform that enables residents to report community problems, prioritize them through a voting system, and track their resolutions. It fosters transparency, community engagement, and efficient problem-solving by connecting residents with local authorities.

### The Problem Statement  
Local communities face difficulties in reporting and addressing common issues like broken infrastructure, environmental hazards, or public safety concerns. Inefficient communication and lack of transparency hinder timely and effective problem resolution.

### The Solution  
The EchoVote platform allows residents to:  
- Report issues via a simple and user-friendly interface.  
- Upvote and prioritize critical problems that need immediate attention.  
- Visualize reported issues on an interactive map.  

Authorities can monitor these issues, prioritize solutions based on votes, and update the status of problems in real-time, ensuring transparency and community engagement.
